# Colour Mapping for Expressions
Calculates a nice colour mapping for relative expressions which is based on a formula of the kind

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=a\frac{1}{e^{b*x}}+c" title="y = a * 1/(e^(b * x )+ c" />
where a,b,c are constants that are chosen so that value differences are visually easy to compare.

after that a standard colour map is applied.
